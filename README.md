# statistical-learning

This repository contains a project developed in R. I used different statistical learning methods on "Lyon Housing" dataset to analyze housing prices in Lyon and then find the best and most suitable house for a student according to some critiria like the price of the house, proximity to the university, and proximity to the nearest station.
